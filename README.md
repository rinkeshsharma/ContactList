# ContactList
This project has the basic implementations of CRUD operations in .NET using MVC
Once you are able to run this application then on the TOP menu - "Contact Repository" link is there, which can be used to navigate to see the functionality
Here, there is one dummy data for contact details are added with Edit and Delete options. You can use "Add new contact" to add new contact deetails.
Once user clicks on Add new contact, he will get the complete form to enter the details with some validations on it. On Submit he can see the new row added.
User can also Edit or delete any existing row.
Due to lack of time, I just provided basic functionality.
